    <p class="blog-text">I'm making a blog to document what I've worked on, and what I'm currently working on. It'll be nice to have something to 
        look at when I've improved from projects. I'm going to be talking about the processes used to create the projects I put onto the site, and what 
        kind of things I'd like to make in the future. Although I've made things using HTML, CSS and JS, this will be my actual first website. This blog will be about 
        the first steps I'm taking to build it, starting with a picture.
    </p>

        <p class="blog-text space-top-bottom">This is a microsoft paint drawing I made of what I plan to make my websites home screen. Displaying one of my blog posts, a project,
            and maybe some information about myself.
            for reference, here's a picture of my home page at the time of posting this blog.

    </div>
    <p class="blog-text">Nav bar isn't great, I don't have any projects on the site so those are just placeholders. That "Newest Blog Post" doesnt even exist yet.
        I'm not sure about colors, and I don't have any projects or text about me to welcome people to my site. I do have a more fleshed out blog section
        for where I'll keep all my blog posts (Like this one!).

            <p class="center-horizontal">This is how the list of blogs looks right now, if it was populated by a bunch of fake posts and with placeholder text.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="float-right">
            <p class="blog-text" style="white-space: pre-line;">The next thing I want to start working on is figuring out what projects will look like on this site.</p>

            <p class="blog-text space-top-bottom">Right now I'm thinking I'm going to make a basic snake game just to figure out a rough template to follow for the site,
                after that I'll probably build out the home page or make the generall CSS look nicer. </p>
            
            <p class="blog-text space-top-bottom">The empty whitespaces on both sides of
                the website are meant to have some kind of image or animation or something, but I still need to find what they should be.
                Hopefull if you're reading this it's a bit prettier by now, and I have a couple of projects up to look at aswell.</p>

            <p class="space-top-bottom blog-text">I think that's about it for my first blog post. I don't know what makes a blog a blog, but 
                thats what I'll call it for lack of a better term. Now I'll get to put this in my list of blog posts and take out all of the fake ones.
                I'll get some more in there soon enough to make it not so lonely.
