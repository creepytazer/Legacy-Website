        <p class="main-text">Snake is a simple 2D game where you move around a little "snake", collecting food to grow longer.
            Bumping into walls or your tail means game over. The game is fairly simple to make. I personally made it
            for testing what projects will look like on my site, and for the practice of documenting the code with a blog.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">starting out making any JavaScript game is make a spot where the game can be played. Which is pretty easy.
            all i did for that was make a div element, shape it into a square, slap some color on there and boom. You have a game board.
        </p>
        <div id="game1-holder" class="side-to-side middle"><div id="game1" class="game"></div>
        <div style="margin: auto; width: fit-content;">
            <span>This is what the CSS looks like for that game square.</span>
    <pre><code>#game {
    width:100%;
    max-width: 300px;
    aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
    margin: 0 auto;
    border: 2px solid black;
    min-width: 540px;
    background: radial-gradient(rgb(54, 145, 81), black);
    }</code></pre>
    <span>a nice, simple green square, perfect for a snake.</span>
        </div>
    
    </div>
    <p class="main-text">The first part of the JavaScript I did was put in a bunch of squares to move between and where the food for our snake spawns.
        I could have done it in the HTML but I could just write a couple lines in JavaScript instead of filling up my HTML doc. Lets just say we want a 
        15x15 playing grid for now, then our JS to initialize our board would look like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="middle"><code>function initializeBoard(size) {
    let gameBoard = document.getElementById("game");
    var html = "";
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
      html += `&lt;div class="game-row" style="height: ${100 / size}%;">`;
      for (var j = 0; j &lt; size; j++) {
        html += `&lt;div class="game-tile" style="height: 92%; width: ${
          92 / size
        }%;">&lt;/div>`;
      }
      html += `&lt;/div>`;
    }
    board.innerHTML = html;
}</code></pre>
<p class="main-text">Whats happening in this? at the top we declare the function, next we find the gameboard in our HTML document.
    after that we start making the HTML by going row by row, column by column, puting evenly sized divs in our gameboard.
</p>
<div class="side-to-side middle">
    <div style="max-width: 350px;">
        <span class="display-text">(the board after we fill it with squares)</span>
        <div id="game2" class="game"></div>
        <span class="display-text">I added some css to the tiles so you can see them, but you could also keep their border off, and the snake will still move locked to the grid.</span>
    </div>
    <div style="margin: 1rem;"><p class="main-text">The rest of the project is actually implementing the game, which if you know some basics with data structures, shouldn't be too hard, especially
        with all the recourses on the internet.
    </p>
    <p class="main-text">all you need is to build a structure to remember where the snakes's head is, along with all of it's segments (I used a linked list), a way for the snake to move
        along with controls, a function to make random coordinates for the food to spawn at and a function to make the snake grow when it eats food.
    </p>
    <div id="text-to-game" class="side-to-side middle">
        <p class="main-text">The hardest part about making a simple game, is dealing with all the edge cases, at least in my opinion. You can
            make the basics of a game pretty quick, but you find a small thing you don't like, then another.. and another...

            <p>I'm thinking I want to implement machine learning with the snake game I made, so I'll be working on either that or expanding more to the website in other areas,
                like contact information or a project list.
